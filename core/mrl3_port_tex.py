"""MRL3 -> MDF2 port, texture layer: unpack MHWI's packed slots into PBR planes.

``core/mdf_tex_processor_base._compose_channels`` already goes the other way -- PBR
planes into one game's packed slots -- and its ``pbr_arrays`` argument exists for this
caller specifically.  What was missing is the half in front of it: MHWI's textures are
packed too, so a port has to *unpack* them first.  Slot -> PBR -> slot is the whole
pipeline, and this module is the first arrow.

**Decoding is not the encoding table read backwards.**  A channel map's entries are
one of three things -- a ``(pbr_type, index)`` tuple, a constant like ``1.0``, or
``None`` meaning "write zero".  Only the tuples carry information; the other two are
what the *writer* puts in a channel nothing feeds.  Reading them back would invent a
PBR plane out of padding.  So the decode table below lists only the channels that
genuinely hold something, and it is written out rather than derived, because two of
its entries disagree with the encode side on purpose:

* ``RMTMap.B`` is **translucency**.  MHWI's RMT is Roughness / Metallic /
  Translucency, and ``games/mhwi/mrl3_tex_processor.MHWI_SLOT_CHANNEL_MAPS`` has that
  channel as ``None`` -- correct or not for MHWI's own export path, reading it as
  nothing here would silently drop every skin and thin-cloth material's translucency
  on the way to MHWilds.  Left as a deliberate difference rather than changing the
  export map, which is a shipped behaviour and a separate question.
* ``AlbedoMap.A`` is **opacity**, and it must not travel with the colour.  MHWilds'
  ``BaseDielectricMap.A`` is *inverted metallic*, so a slot-to-slot copy of the albedo
  would feed opacity into the metal channel and turn the whole model to chrome.  Here
  it becomes the ``alpha`` plane, which the encoder then routes to
  ``AlphaTranslucentOcclusionSSSMap.R``.

MHWI has no AO channel at all (``RMTMap.B`` is translucency, not occlusion), so no
``ao`` plane is produced.  That is not a gap to fill: ``PBR_DEFAULTS['ao']`` is white,
so leaving it absent gives exactly the white AO the user asked for.

Free of ``bpy``: takes and returns numpy arrays, so the channel routing can be tested
without Blender.

    *slot_arrays* is ``{slot type: (h, w, 4) float32}``; slots the material does not
    use are simply absent.

    Every plane comes out at one size, the largest input's.  ``_compose_channels``
    now scales mismatched ``pbr_arrays`` entries as well -- it used to drop them, and
    this port is what made that reachable, since MHWI is free to give a 512px RMT to
    a 2048px albedo -- so this is no longer load-bearing.  It is kept because it is
    the layer that can say *which slot* was rescaled: by the time the planes reach
    the encoder they are anonymous quantities, and "roughness was 512px" is a much
    worse report than "RMTMap was".  Resampling is nearest-neighbour, sufficient
    because a material's slots normally already agree.

    A plane is created only when some channel writes to it, and it starts from that
    quantity's neutral default, so a slot that supplies two of four channels does not
    leave the other two at zero.
