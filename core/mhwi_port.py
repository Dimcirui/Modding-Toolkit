"""MHWI -> MHWS port, planning layer: the constants a rebuild needs.

This is a *rebuild*, not a conversion, and that is a deliberate split from
``core/mesh_port.py``.  The RE-to-RE port rests on one premise, stated in
``mesh_port_ops.apply_corrections``: "the mesh is already correct, only the bone
layout differs" -- so every step there is a rest-pose edit that provably moves no
vertex.  Crossing from MT Framework to RE Engine breaks that premise three ways:

* the two bodies are different proportions (thigh -9.1%, torso -7.8%, Hip->Thigh +42%),
* MHWI's thumb is axis-aligned like its other fingers and MHWilds' is not (29 degrees),
* the two games put their origin in different places (1.0468 m apart).

All three need the *mesh* to move with the skeleton, so this pipeline is
pose-then-bake throughout, via ``core/pose_bake.py``.

Everything here is measured, not assumed -- see ``docs/mhwi_mhws_port_notes.md`` for
the raw numbers and the reference rigs they came from.  Free of ``bpy`` so the
partitioning can be unit-tested offline.

#: Vertical offset from MHWI's origin to MHWilds', in metres.
#:
#: **Deliberately a constant, not derived from the loaded reference** (user's
#: decision, 2026-08-15).  The tempting derivation -- "translate so the source Hip
#: lands on the reference's Hip" -- keys off a landmark authors move: MHWilds' COG
#: and Hip get shifted by some riggers.  What neither game's authors move is the
#: **sole plane**, so that is what this aligns, and relative to each game's own
#: origin the sole plane is fixed.  Hence one number rather than a measurement.
#:
#: Measured on the reference bodies: MHWI's sole sits at z = -1.0468 with its origin
#: ``MhBone_000`` at z = 0; MHWilds' ground plane is its ``root`` at z = 0.
#:
#: Not to be confused with the Hip-to-Hip distance, which is 1.02 -- MHWI's hip rides
#: 2.7 cm higher above its own sole than MHWilds' does, so aligning hips would sink
#: the model 2.7 cm into the ground.  Nor with the mesh-sole-to-mesh-sole distance
#: (1.0518): a body mesh's lowest vertex is not stable, the same MHWilds body's sole
#: moves 8 mm just from the T-pose conversion straightening its 8-degree thigh splay.
SOLE_OFFSET_Z = 1.0468

#: Pose-space rotations that put MHWI's thumb where MHWilds' thumb is, applied at the
#: named bone about its own head, **in list order**: the second entry is the residual
#: left after the first has already swung the rest of the chain.
#:
#: MHWI's thumb phalanges run along the hand axis exactly like its other fingers
#: (``Thumb2 -> Thumb3`` is ``(1, 0, 0)``); MHWilds' are splayed.  Every other finger
#: matches to 0.00 degrees, so this is the one place the two hands genuinely differ.
#:
#: The left and right axes are mirror images in the axial-vector sense (x keeps its
#: sign, y and z flip) and the angles agree to three decimals -- that self-consistency
#: is why these are trusted as signal rather than fit noise.
THUMB_ROTATIONS = {
    "L": [("MhBone_031", (-0.1216, 0.2002, -0.9722), 29.025),

#: What differs per destination game.  MHWilds was the only target for a long time,
#: so what used to be four module constants is now one row each.
#:
#: MHRS's row is nearly empty, and that is the measurement rather than a stub:
#:
#: * ``sole_offset = 0`` -- MHWI and MHRS are the *same rest frame*.  16 landmarks
#:   over the two reference bodies, max deviation 0.0022 m, most exactly zero, and
#:   identical bounding boxes to four decimals.  Both measure from the pelvis while
#:   MHWilds measures from the ground, which is the whole of SOLE_OFFSET_Z.
#: * ``rotate_thumbs = False`` -- the thumb swing is a *MHWilds* fixup, not an MHWI
#:   quirk.  MHWI's thumb axis sits 24.19 deg from MHWilds' and **0.351 deg** from
#:   MHRS's, so applying it here would introduce the error it exists to remove.
#: * ``optimize_ops = ()`` -- ``mhws.optimize_skeleton`` and ``mhws.optimize_aux_bones``
#:   are MHWilds' own helper-system passes.  MHRS has no helper system to optimise
#:   and no such operators; there is nothing to substitute, not merely nothing wired.
#:
#: ``preset`` is the bone preset's *filename*.  MH Rise's is still ``mhwr.json`` for
#: compatibility with existing user presets even though its game_code is ``MHRS``.
