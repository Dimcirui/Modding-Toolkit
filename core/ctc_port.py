"""MHWI ctc/ccl -> MHWilds chain2/clsp, planning layer: the tables a rebuild needs.

This is the third cross-game port in the family, and it is a **rebuild** for the same
reason ``core/mrl3_port.py`` is: the two containers do not have the same shape.  ctc
has two levels (chain -> node); chain2 has three (settings -> group -> node), and the
collision shapes live in a separate ``.clsp`` entirely.  Aligning containers would
produce a half-legal file, so the pipeline reads the *bindings and parameters* out of
ctc/ccl and drives RE-Chain-Editor's own builders to make a fresh chain2 + clsp.

**The mapping in here is the user's, from experience with both games -- it is not
derived from the reference assets and must not be "corrected" against them.**  The
scene the work was validated in has both games' files hand-tuned per game, so a
parameter diff against it measures the author's tuning, not this table.  See
``docs/mhwi_physics_port_plan.md`` §10, which this module is the executable form of.

Two consequences of that worth stating up front, because both look like bugs:

* Most of ctc's chain parameters are **deliberately dropped**.  Only five carry a
  value across.  ``LimitForce`` / ``springLimitRate`` and ``ReflectCoef`` /
  ``coefOfElasticity`` in particular are name-similar pairs that are *not* verified
  to mean the same thing, so pairing them would be a guess dressed up as a mapping.
* Every dropped field is reported rather than silently ignored, because a chain that
  relied on one comes out subtly wrong and -- per the MHWmodfixer findings recorded
  in the plan doc -- broken chain physics surfaces **only at game boot**.  Nothing in
  the export path, the file, or the scene will say a word.

Free of ``bpy``: pure tables and pure functions, so the whole translation is checkable
offline in ``tests/test_ctc_port.py``.

#: constant rather than a blanket rule is that MHW Model Editor already converted
#: *some* fields on import (``ctc_properties.getCTCChain`` divides ``Gravity`` and
#: ``LimitForce`` by 100) and left others alone.  Dividing everything again would
#: silently shrink gravity to -0.098.
#:

#: **collision shapes do not**: both addons' importers write metres into
#: ``obj.location`` / ``obj.scale`` (ccl_properties.py:42,63 and
#: re_chain_propertyGroups.py:172,242), so a collider ports by copying those two and

#: spelling differs: ctc keeps a matrix (``NodeMatrix``, written to
#: ``frame.matrix_local``) and chain2 a quaternion (``angleLimitDirectionX/Y/Z/W``,
#: written to ``frame.rotation_quaternion``).
#:
#: Both also agree on which axis means "along the chain": the frame's **local X**.
#: RE-Chain-Editor's own ``chain_from_bone`` builds its frame by rotating X onto the
#: direction of the next node (``re_chain_operators.py:149-176``), and the reference
#: ctc's frames sit on that same direction to 0.00 degrees across all 124 of its
#: non-terminal nodes.
#:
#: **That 0.00 is a property of that asset, not of the format** (user, 2026-08-16):
#: pointing at the next node is the *default*, and authors hand-adjust away from it.
#: Measured on the reference MHWilds chain2, which does contain hand-tuning: 45 of its
#: 224 non-terminal frames deviate, up to 66.6 degrees, and every one of them is a
#: skirt bone -- exactly where an author turns the limit outward so a panel swings
#: away from the leg instead of collapsing onto it.
#:
#: So the direction has to be *carried*, not recomputed.  A recomputed port of a
#: hand-tuned chain does not look broken, which is the problem: every cone points
#: plausibly along its chain, just not where the author put it.
FRAME_FORWARD_AXIS = "X"

#: Terminal nodes carry a meaningless frame, by both tools' own account.  MHW Model
#: Editor hides their cone by default and says so outright ("the last node is
#: typically unused and has a dummy rotation value"); measured, 42 of the reference
#: body's 42 chain-terminal frames are identity while **no** mid-chain frame is.
#: So a terminal frame that fails to match is not a defect worth reporting.
