"""LuaBoneSystem custom-offset JSON, written from a Blender rig.

MHRS has one skeleton per character, so the usual way to give an armour set its
own proportions -- exporting a reshaped ``{gender}_shadow.mesh`` over
``mod/{gender}/bone/`` -- reshapes *every* outfit at once.  LuaBoneSystem is the
way around that: a REFramework script that, each frame, moves the player's joints
by a per-equipment offset table read from
``reframework/data/LUABoneSystem/custom/<part file name>.json``.

The table the script writes when the user presses its own "Bind" button is

    offset[joint] = LocalPosition(equipped rig)[joint] - LocalPosition(base rig)[joint]

which is a **parent-relative rest translation difference, in the game's own
coordinates** -- and that is a thing Blender already has, so the round trip
through the game is not necessary.  ``bone.matrix_local`` relative to the parent's
reproduces the game's ``LocalPosition`` exactly: three independently recorded
tables (two armour sets from a mod pack, one from a live MHRise install) each
round-trip to their rig with a maximum error of 1.6e-7 m, which is float32
round-off, not a discrepancy.

Two things the recorded tables show that a naive subtraction would get wrong:

* **Seven joints are always zero.**  ``Root``, ``Cog``, ``Face_Parts``,
  ``LookAt``, ``PL_Cam`` and the two ``*_Foot_IK`` are control joints, not deform
  joints; the script's own base table omits them entirely and its ``nil`` branch
  writes zeros.  Writing a computed offset for them instead would move things the
  game never intends the mesh to move.
* **The five files are identical.**  The script scans the equipped parts and uses
  the *first* json it manages to load for the whole player (``player_joint`` is one
  name, not five), so five different tables would mean an arbitrary winner.  Every
  reference set ships five byte-identical files, and this writes them the same way
  -- one rig in, five copies out.  ``f_body279.json`` measured against an
  ``f_arm279`` rig matches 72/72, which is the same fact from the other side.
