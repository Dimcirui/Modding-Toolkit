"""Custom split normal tools for face meshes.

Why a cylinder
--------------
Reverse-engineering the shipped face meshes (MHWS `face`, MHWI `f_face002`)
shows the custom split normals are not the mesh's own smooth normals and not a
transfer from a modelled proxy head.  Over the frontal region they are, to
within one degree, the horizontal radial direction from the vertical axis
through the object's local origin — a mathematically exact cylinder.  Nose,
lips and eye sockets vanish from the shading entirely, which is the point: a
cylindrical field gives a purely left-right light falloff with no nose shadow,
and it stays stable when the head tilts.

Outside that region (ears, back of the skull, the neck cap) the mesh keeps its
own angle-weighted smooth normals bit-exact, and the mask is a hard per-face
selection with no feathering.  The front/side transition is not painted: it
falls out of averaging the two fields at the shared boundary vertices, weighted
by corner angle, which makes it exactly one vertex wide.  Reproducing a shipped
head this way lands at 0.57 degrees p90 across the skin.

The mask cannot be derived — an angle threshold, the vertex colour layers and a
frontal-cone isoline were all measured against the shipped meshes and all fail
(the isoline scores well per-loop but cuts across edge loops, so the boundary
comes out visibly jagged).  It has to be a face selection.

Resetting
---------
The game will not take a mesh with welded seams, so a body ships cut into many
pieces: split vertices, sharp edges and separate objects along every seam.
`reset_normals` shades that back as if it were one uncut surface — it gathers
the selected objects into world space, groups every corner by *position*, and
gives each group the angle-weighted average of the face normals meeting there.
No shading groups, no sharp-edge splits, no per-vertex fans: the split is
ignored at calculation time and left completely intact in the mesh, because the
answer is written as custom split normals, which override sharp edges for
shading without removing them.

The one thing to know is that averaging across a position is unconditional by
design, so two coincident surfaces facing opposite ways (eyelash cards) cancel
out.  Those positions are detected rather than silently emitted as noise, and
`angle_limit` below 180 is the escape hatch.
