"""Shared slot resolution: turning one source image into one game .tex.

The processor (existing MDF → replace textures) and the generators (Blender
material → new MDF from preset) start from different places and should keep
separate entry points — "I have the original MDF" and "I am building from
scratch" are genuinely different starting points, and merging them would just
push the difference into UI branches.

What must *not* be duplicated is the tail: given a source image file and a
destination, write the game's .tex.  That block had drifted into seven near
copies:

  - the processor handled .tex passthrough and .dds direct conversion; the
    generators did not, so a .dds source was needlessly decoded and
    re-compressed through texconv
  - MHWI's tex writer takes (dds_paths, out), the RE games' takes
    (dds_paths, version, out)

Callers pass ``dds_to_tex`` already bound to their tex version, which is what
lets one function serve both signatures.

    suits MHWI's MRL3 normals: the shader ignores B there, so the safer four-
