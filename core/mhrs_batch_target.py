"""The MHRS end of a batch port: bind the results, export them, clear the source.

Shared by every batch flow that *lands* in MHRS -- ``core/mhwi_batch_port.py`` and
``core/mhws_batch_port.py`` -- because none of what follows depends on where the
set came from.  Everything here takes the same ``results`` shape: one dict per
MHRS part, carrying ``part`` and the ``mesh``/``mdf2``/``chain`` collections plus
``armature``, with ``skip`` set on the parts that produced nothing.

The one thing that *is* source-specific is which collections to delete afterwards,
and that is passed in as a predicate rather than guessed -- see ``discard_source``.

**A part does not need a chain of its own.**  Authors routinely put the cloth
physics on the body alone and let the other parts inherit it, and the source games
resolve a chain against the body skeleton, which is authoritative.  To keep that, a
part with no physics of its own is given **the body's ported chain**, not a copy of
it: the same collection is simply exported again under that part's file name, which
is byte-for-byte what "the body's physics, on this part too" means and cannot lose a
node to a bone the part's own rig happens not to carry.  ``resolve_chain_sources``
decides this; ``export`` acts on it.

    Safe to delete those because the ports never work in place: they duplicate the

    Worth doing rather than leaving to the user, for three reasons, in order of how
    much they cost:

    * The importer reuses a group collection of the same name, and a group name is a
      vanilla armour slot code, so a leftover set is what makes a later port of a
      *different* mod for the same slot ambiguous.  ``discover``'s *created* set
      already resolves that ambiguity; clearing the scene means it does not arise.
    * A source set is heavy, and it has served its purpose the moment the port is done.
    * Unlinking alone would not do it: an object dropped from every collection still
      sits in ``bpy.data`` at zero users until the file is saved and reloaded, as does
      its mesh.  So the data-blocks go too.

    Only data-blocks left with **no users** are removed, which is what keeps this from
    reaching into the port's output: anything the new materials genuinely share -- an
    image, say -- still has a user and stays.
