"""MHWI -> MHWS rebuild, execution layer.

Crossing engines is a rebuild, not a conversion, and the shape of the rebuild is the
opposite of what the RE-to-RE port does.  ``mesh_port`` converts the source rig in
place: rename its bones, merge what the target lacks, *build* what the target needs.
Building bones by rule is the weak part -- placement comes from a table of anchors
rather than from the target game, and it showed: 89 helper bones inserted, up to
250 mm from where MHWilds actually puts them, six of them parentless because the
insert order is alphabetical rather than hierarchical.

So the skeleton is not converted here, it is **replaced**.  The output rig is
MHWilds' own reference skeleton -- correct names, hierarchy, helper set and
orientations by construction -- snapped onto the MHWI model's joint positions so it
takes the *model's* proportions.  Nothing is placed by rule and nothing can come out
parentless (user's design, 2026-08-15).

The order matters, and the first two steps are the only ones that touch the mesh::

    1. translate    rig + meshes up by SOLE_OFFSET_Z, so the sole planes meet
    2. thumbs       swing MHWI's thumbs onto MHWilds' splay, mesh follows
    3. reference    import MHWilds' reference model, merge its facial bones, T-pose
                    it, discard its body mesh
    4. snap         move the *reference's* bones onto the MHWI rig's joints,
                    position only -- the mesh is not touched
    5. assemble     a .mesh collection holding the snapped rig and the meshes,
                    rebound to it
    6. vertex groups renamed MHWI -> MHWilds
    7. physics      graft the model's own cloth/hair bones onto the new rig
    8. optimise     the two MHWilds skeleton passes

Steps 1 and 2 move the mesh and so go through ``core/pose_bake.py``; step 4 moves the
skeleton to the mesh instead, which is why it can be a plain rest edit and why the
2.6 cm the old direction lost at the ankle simply does not arise -- MHWilds' ankle is
2.6 cm lower than MHWI's above the sole, and here it is the ankle that moves.

Nearly every step is an existing operator; see ``docs/mhwi_mhws_port_notes.md``.
