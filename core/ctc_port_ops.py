"""MHWI ctc/ccl -> MHWilds chain2, execution layer.

``core/ctc_port.py`` decides *what* a value becomes; this decides *where it goes*.
The shape of the job follows the plan doc's §3: nothing is converted at file level.
The ctc collection is read for its bindings and parameters, and RE-Chain-Editor's own
operators build a fresh chain2 -- so every object comes out with the geometry nodes,
materials, hooks, cone helpers and constraints that addon expects, none of which is
worth reimplementing.

**One output collection, not two.**  Colliders land in a ``Chain Collisions - ...``
child of the chain2 collection, parented to its header, and the ``.clsp`` is exported
from there.  A standalone .clsp collection is what *import* produces, not something to
build: RE-Chain-Editor's own ``clspErrorCheck`` rejects a header-less collection
outright.  ``core/chain_convert.duplicate_chain_collection`` reached the same
conclusion the hard way and its docstring records it.

Three things here are not obvious from the code they call:

* **Frame rotations go through world space.**  See ``bone_correction.relocalise_frame``.  The
  two node rotations that formula needs are read from **pose bones**, not from the node
  objects -- measured, a node's world rotation matches its bound bone's to 1.2e-7, and
  going via the bone means the maths does not depend on a constraint having been
  evaluated.  That matters because the build runs with ``alignChains`` patched out.
* **The source is read once, up front.**  A single ``view_layer.update()`` then every
  matrix is captured, before anything is created.  Reading source matrices lazily
  during the build would interleave with the very depsgraph churn the patch avoids.
* **Neither builder lets us choose bone order.**  ``chain_from_bone`` and
  ``collision_from_bone`` both read ``bpy.context.selected_pose_bones``, which is in
  *armature* order, not selection order.  So both results are verified and fixed up
  afterwards rather than trusted -- a capsule with its ends swapped is a legal file
  that behaves wrong, which is the failure mode this whole port has to avoid.
