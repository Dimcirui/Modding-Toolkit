"""MRL3 -> MDF2 port, planning layer: what one MHWI material becomes in MHWilds.

**Every material becomes ``basic``, unconditionally** (user's decision, 2026-08-16).
That is not a shortcut, it is the only honest reading of the data.  ``core/mdf_port.py``
classifies an RE material by its own ``.mmtr``, and refuses to guess from the name --
right there, because each RE archetype has its own shader.  MHWI has no such signal:
``PL_Mt`` is a one-for-all material, and measured on a model hand-ported to both games
it backs *skin, hair, eye and cloth alike*.  Face and Iris come out byte-identical on
the MHWI side -- same mmtr, same ``surfaceCoef``, same ``alphaCoef``, same texture set
-- yet the author made one skin and the other eye.  There is nothing to classify on.

MHWilds happens to have its own one-for-all material, ``Base_Equip.mmtr``, which is
what this addon ships as the ``basic`` prefab; ``skin`` and ``hair`` are its
specialisations for those surfaces and ``standard`` is its advanced variant, not a
"default".  So a MHWI material maps to ``basic`` and the user promotes it afterwards
with "Convert to another MDF material", which exists for exactly this.

An earlier version branched to ``standard`` when ``alphaCoef[2]`` said the material
was transparent.  Dropped as too clever: on the reference pair that rule would have
sent 2 of 17 materials to ``standard`` while the author had put 14 there, so it
neither reproduced the hand port nor stayed predictable.  Transparency survives as a
*flag* instead -- see ``decode_flags``.

Free of ``bpy``: a table over the shipped prefab, checkable offline.

    * ``two_side`` reproduced the author's ``BaseTwoSideEnable`` on 13 of 17.  The four

      single-sided in MHWilds though MHWI had them double, and two cloth pieces went
      the other way.

      more that the coefs call opaque.  So this turns the flag *on* where MHWI says it
